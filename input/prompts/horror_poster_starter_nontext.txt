In a dimly lit corridor, a girl in a red sequined dress glances around anxiously. The air grows still—then a sudden gust cuts through the silence. From the shadows, a cloaked figure creeps forward. Without warning, a dark, tattered bag is yanked over her head. She thrashes violently, her blood-curdling scream echoing down the hallway. Her bare arms flail in panic as she's dragged backward into darkness. Red warning lights stutter and flicker as the camera shudders, then blurs—cutting to black, her scream still ringing.
