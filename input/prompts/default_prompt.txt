In a dim, flickering bunker, a terrified girl in a green Squid Game tracksuit stands frozen as a monstrous creature bursts through a metal door, snarling. Chaos eruptsâ€”players scream and scatter. The girl stumbles back, eyes wide, narrowly dodging the beast as it attacks someone nearby. She turns and runs as the monster roars behind her, the camera following in a gritty, cinematic style.
